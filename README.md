### Build
Check if you have the modules already installed, otherwise it'll break. If you don't, just run `pip install -r modules.txt`. 

### Usage
Just edit the `core.py` file according to the needs. It already features a `setup` and a `draw` function, which respectively runs once and runs all of the time. To load any font, images, sprites and anything else, please use the `pygame` module.

### Progress
* [X] Main files and basic functions
* [ ] Better readability
* [ ] Using indipendet modules
* [ ] Fix eventual bugs
* [ ] Rewrite everything in C++ (?)
